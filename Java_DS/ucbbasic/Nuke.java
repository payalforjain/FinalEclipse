/* Write a program called "Nuke2.java" containing a class called Nuke2 whose main
method reads a string from the keyboard and prints the same string, with its
second character removed. (Thatâ€™s character number 1, since Java numbers
characters in a string starting from zero.) In other words, after you run
"java Nuke2", if you type in the string "skin", the program will print "sin".*/
