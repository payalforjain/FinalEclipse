	 * 
	 * Java Solution
	 * 
	 * Given two numbers a and b, a&b returns the number formed by '1' bits on a
	 * and b. When it is left shifted by 1 bit, it is the carry.
	 * 
	 * For example, given a=101 and b=111 (in binary), the a&b=101. a&b << 1 =
	 * 1010.
	 * 
	 * a^b is the number formed by different bits of a and b. a&b=10.
