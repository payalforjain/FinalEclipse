Reversing an integer can be done similarly to reversing a string.

We want to repeatedly "pop" the last digit off of xx and "push" it to the back of the \text{rev}rev. In the end, \text{rev}rev will be the reverse of the xx.

To "pop" and "push" digits without the help of some auxiliary stack/array, we can use math.

//pop operation:
pop = x % 10;
x /= 10;

//push operation:
temp = rev * 10 + pop;
rev = temp;
