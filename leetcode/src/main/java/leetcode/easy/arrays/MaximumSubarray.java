public class MaximumSubarray {
/*
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.*/

    //Mehdi provided the following solution in his comment. The space complexity is optimized to be O(1)
    public int maxSubArray(int[] A) {
        int newsum=A[0];
        int max=A[0];
        for(int i=1;i<A.length;i++){
            newsum=Math.max(newsum+A[i],A[i]);
            max= Math.max(max, newsum);
