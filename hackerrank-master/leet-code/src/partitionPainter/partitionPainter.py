# You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2 ... AN-1}. There are K
# painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes
# to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as
# possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint
# continuous sections of board, say board {2, 3, 4} or only board {1} or
# nothing but not board {2, 4, 5}.
