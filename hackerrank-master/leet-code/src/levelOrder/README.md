Problem
===
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

	For example:
	Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
	    3
	   / \
	  9  20
	    /  \
	   15   7
	return its level order traversal as:
	[
	  [3],
	  [9,20],
	  [15,7]
	]

Solution
===

BFS, use a counter to track the size of current level, and break output into levels
