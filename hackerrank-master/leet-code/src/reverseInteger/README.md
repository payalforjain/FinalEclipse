Problem
===
Reverse digits of an integer.

	Example1: x = 123, return 321
	Example2: x = -123, return -321


Have you thought about this?
Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!

If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.

Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?

Throw an exception? Good, but what if throwing an exception is not an option? You would then have to re-design the function (ie, add an extra parameter).

Solution
===

In python the integer is unlimited, so no overflow can happen

In static-typed languages, use a long integer to hold overflows, then cast back 

Note: Integer.MIN_VALUE doesn't have inverse in the int range.
