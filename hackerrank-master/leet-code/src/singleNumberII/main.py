# Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one.

# Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you
# implement it without using extra memory?

# idea: think of the final answer as the value that all bits count together
# the result should be all bits in a certain position mod 3 == 1, the
# corresponding value
