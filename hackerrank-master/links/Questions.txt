ZenDesk Phone:
Write a program which will take in a sentence, and produce 2 arrays which will then be stored in an archive.
The first array will contain all the unique words in the original text. and second array will contain integer indexes.
There will be one index in this second array for each word in the original document

Input: this specification is the specification for a specification
Output: words = ["this", "specification", "is", "the", "for", "a"]
        sentence = [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 1]
