How to find a median in a large file of 64-bit integers.
I mentioned first the classical "order statistics" algorithm with splitting initial group into 5-tuples and finding median of medians, etc. My proposal on the problem was toadopt median algorithm to the case when we are dealing with large file – however no additional disk space could be used, it should be done "in place" and it is not clear for me if order statistics algorithm could be done easily with such restriction. Interviewer downplayed the order statistics deal and navigated me to the solution that I liked – keep in memory counters for binary intervals practically counting occurences of prefixes (say, 24-bit prefixes). After that we are able to tell what prefix range the median belongs to, recalculate index of the element to search instead of median and go over the particular prefix range and find it there. Sweet.

After two week got rejection as not matching with current open positions.

How to find a median in a large file of 64-bit integers   View Answer
Input is a 4x4 table with letters. One starts from any of the 16 elements and can move in one step to any of the 8 neighboring cells not visited before (up, down, left, right, up-left, etc, no hyperspace jumps between rows 1 & 4, columns 1 & 4).
Every time step is made letter in that cell is added so a word is built as we walk. These generated words are looked up in external dictionary (function to look up in the dictionary is provided, I did not understand significance of this dictionary well) and the goal of the exercise is to output all words generated by all possible table walks and which are contained in the dictionary.
